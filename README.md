# Visualize the data
## Goal
Visualize the provided data using any view library or framework. 

### Requirements
- use any view library/framework
- use provided data as an initial state for the application
- render visualization of provided data that closely resembles figure 1

### Optional
- use any additional opensource libraries
- implement visual improvements to figure 1 if you feel itâ€™ll make it better

### State
We will refer to this data further only as provided data. Provided data can be accessed at [Github](https://gist.github.com/char0n/99eb9c1f088baf8f7a147a97dfd36d5c). Provided data are in JSON, and the format of the data is called Api Elements. API elements are generated from API Description Document written in swagger which can be accessed at [Gist](https://gist.github.com/char0n/7fc711a057c69cdb70c26e36307ae9e3). Apiary is using API Elements and renders the documentation directly from it. We recommend reading introduction to API Elements to get familiar with ideas behind API elements and Refract. You can access it at https://api-elements.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
We also have a tool called minim at [Github](https://github.com/refractproject/minim-api-description) that can query and manipulate the provided data. You may choose to use it if you wish.

### Implementation
Publish your work on github as if it would be open source project and do whatever you would consider important for it to thrive.
